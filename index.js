// REPL stands for "Read-Eval-Print Loop". It is a feature in Node.js that allows you to interactively run and test JavaScript code.
// Eval -->> Evaluate

// With Node.js REPL, you can type JavaScript code and immediately see the results of its execution. The REPL provides a prompt where you can enter your code, and it will evaluate the code and display the result.

// The Node.js REPL can be accessed by typing "node" in your terminal or command prompt. Once you start the Node.js REPL, you can enter JavaScript code and see the results immediately. For example, if you type "2 + 2" in the REPL, it will return 4.

// Yes, that's correct. REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) in Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code directly on your terminal/command prompt. It provides an interactive environment where you can enter and execute JavaScript code snippets, one line at a time, and see the results immediately.
